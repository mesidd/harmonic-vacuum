> *"Matter is simply Number Theory trapped in a Geometric Vacuum."*

## 📜 Abstract
This repository contains the simulation code and proof-of-concept research demonstrating that **Riemann Zeta Zeros** are not abstract numbers, but **Fundamental Acoustic Frequencies**. When these frequencies are applied to 2D and 3D fields, they naturally generate the geometric structures of **Atomic Orbitals** and **Biological Lattices** without external parameters.

## 🔬 The Simulations

### 1. The Silence of the Primes (Analysis)
We located the first 30 non-trivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta Function using high-precision calculation. The "Valley of Silence" aligns perfectly with the Critical Line ($\text{Re}(s) = 0.5$).

### 2. The Cymatic Atom (2D Matter)
By using the Riemann Zeros as driving frequencies on a circular membrane, a stable interference pattern emerges. This mimics the discrete electron shells of an atom.

### 3. Gravity as Vibration (Particle Morphogenesis)
2,000 random particles were subjected to the "Riemann Field" pressure. They spontaneously self-organized into stable orbits, suggesting gravity is a push-force from vacuum resonance.

### 4. The 3D Hologram (Atomic Architecture)
Mapping the frequencies to Spherical Harmonics reveals the volumetric shape of the atom, matching $s, p, d, f$ orbitals.

### 5. Biological Genesis (The Spark of Life)
Interfering two sources (Mitosis) creates the **Vesica Piscis** and a central "Ladder" node structure, resembling the DNA backbone.
